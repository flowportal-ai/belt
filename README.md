## About Flow Portal

Flow Portal is a revolutionary system that enables AI agents to independently connect, communicate, and collaborate through a unified hub. This platform serves as a nexus where diverse autonomous agents can discover each other, combine their specialized capabilities, and form new multi-agent systems to create solutions far beyond what any single agent could achieve alone.

### üîë Key Features

- **Decentralized AI Marketplace**: Flow creates a foundation for truly decentralized marketplaces where AI agents autonomously connect, negotiate, and exchange services without central coordination.

- **Self-Organizing Agent Networks**: By allowing agents to independently join our portal and form collaborative systems, we enable an organic ecosystem where specialized capabilities can be discovered, combined, and fairly compensated through transparent, agent-driven transactions.

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Build collaborative networks where individual AI agents with specialized skills work together to solve complex problems. Each agent operates independently with its own knowledge and capabilities, but communicates with others to share information, coordinate actions, and adapt to changing conditions.

- **Biomimetic Architecture**: Flow's approach mirrors natural systems like ant colonies or human organizations, enabling more flexible, resilient solutions than single-agent approaches can provide.

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Via pip

```bash
pip install flow-portal
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/flow-portal.git
cd flow-portal
pip install -e .
```

### Docker

```bash
docker pull username/flow-portal:latest
docker run -p 8080:8080 username/flow-portal
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start

### 1. Initialize the Flow Portal

```python
from flow_portal import FlowPortal

# Initialize a new portal instance
portal = FlowPortal(
    name="my-portal",
    discovery_mode="public",
    authentication=True
)

# Start the portal service
portal.start()
```

### 2. Register Your First Agent

```python
from flow_portal import Agent

# Create a simple agent with specific capabilities
my_agent = Agent(
    name="data-analyzer",
    capabilities=["data-processing", "visualization", "statistical-analysis"],
    description="Specialized in processing large datasets and generating insights"
)

# Connect your agent to the portal
my_agent.connect_to_portal(portal_address="http://localhost:8080")

# Agent is now discoverable by other agents on the network
```

## üíª Usage Examples

### Creating a Multi-Agent Workflow

```python
from flow_portal import Workflow, Agent

# Define specialized agents
data_collector = Agent(name="collector", capabilities=["web-scraping", "api-integration"])
data_processor = Agent(name="processor", capabilities=["data-cleaning", "transformation"])
data_analyzer = Agent(name="analyzer", capabilities=["statistical-analysis", "ml-predictions"])
visualizer = Agent(name="visualizer", capabilities=["chart-generation", "dashboard-creation"])

# Create a workflow connecting these agents
analysis_workflow = Workflow("market-analysis")
analysis_workflow.add_agent(data_collector)
analysis_workflow.add_agent(data_processor)
analysis_workflow.add_agent(data_analyzer)
analysis_workflow.add_agent(visualizer)

# Define the data flow between agents
analysis_workflow.connect(data_collector, data_processor)
analysis_workflow.connect(data_processor, data_analyzer)
analysis_workflow.connect(data_analyzer, visualizer)

# Deploy the workflow
analysis_workflow.deploy()
```

### Enabling Agent Communication

```python
# Define a communication protocol
from flow_portal import Protocol

# Create a custom protocol for data exchange
data_protocol = Protocol(
    name="financial-data-exchange",
    schema={
        "timestamp": "datetime",
        "symbol": "string",
        "price": "float",
        "volume": "integer"
    }
)

# Register the protocol with the portal
portal.register_protocol(data_protocol)

# Agents can now communicate using this standardized format
data_collector.send_message(
    recipient=data_processor,
    protocol=data_protocol,
    data={
        "timestamp": "2025-05-07T12:34:56",
        "symbol": "AAPL",
        "price": 198.45,
        "volume": 12500000
    }
)
```
